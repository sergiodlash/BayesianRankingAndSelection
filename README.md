# Bayesian Ranking and Selection for listening tests

Repository contains a reinterpretation of [Petteri Hyvärinen's post](https://petterihyvarinen.fi/blog/posts/bayesian-mushra/) on how to use Bayesian inference methods for listening tests. The main focus is on the implementation, but for our case using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). For more detailed explanations, refer to the [post](https://petterihyvarinen.fi/blog/posts/bayesian-mushra/).
